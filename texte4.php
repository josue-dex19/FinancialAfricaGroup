                <h3>INTRODUCTION:</h3>
                <strong>SMIIC</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>The Standards and Metrology Institute for Islamic Countries (SMIIC) is an intergovernmental standardization organization affiliated with the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). SMIIC, as a sound mechanism for harmonization of standards
                    among the OIC Countries and for the preparation of new ones, aims at realizing common standards, achieving uniformity in metrology, laboratory testing, and establishing accreditation schemes for the purpose of expediting the exchange
                    of materials, manufactured goods and products in the Muslim World under the umbrella of the OIC.</p>
                <p>Standards are key tools for people to reach products with minimum cost but with quality. Harmonization of standards, metrology, and accreditation is vital for accelerating the development of Muslim country economies. Its use will promote
                    common understanding throughout all member states. Common standards, metrology, and accreditation framework eliminates trade barriers and facilitates trade between the OIC member states and the entire world. In an age of globalization
                    and economic interdependence, Islamic countries need to work together to establish fully functional and sustainable knowledge-based economies. This is why The Standards and Metrology Institute for Islamic Countries (SMIIC) is mandated
                    by OIC to act as a professional entity in studying standardization, metrology, and accreditation fields and developing standards that will display the interests of the Islamic World.</p>

                <strong>ICDT</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>The Islamic Centre for Development of Trade (ICDT), established in Casablanca in 1984, is the subsidiary Organ of the OIC responsible for promoting trade and investments in the OIC countries. With more than 38 years of experience serving
                    public and private operators of OIC Member States, ICDT works to encourage regular trade exchanges within the OIC Region, promote investments likely to develop trade flows, contribute to building public and private sector capacity
                    in trade and investment-related areas and assisting the Member States in trade promotion and negotiations.</p>
                <p>The development of the Halal sector is at the heart of ICDT's activities through the organization of a capacity building program on raising awareness of Halal certification, the organization of a Halal Exhibition and B2B forums and meetings
                    every year in an OIC country as well as the publication of an annual report on the industry of the sector for the benefit of the public and private sectors of the Member States.</p>
                <p>The ICDT organizes during 2022, the 9th Edition of the OIC Halal Exhibition in Tunis from September 14 to 18, 2022, Halal Bahrain from October 6 to 8, 2022, and the 10th edition of the OIC Halal Exhibition in Istanbul from November 24

                <strong>Halal</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Over the last decade, the halal industry has gone global and we all watched and experienced how it occurred. And by witnessing its expansion, we became more accountable for our roles and tasks as the actors in the halal industry. With
                    this regard, SMIIC, as the unity of 46 countries, approaches to halal in line with its new vision which is “Creating a quality infrastructure that improves the economy, welfare and protects our Member States”.</p>
                <p>This vision also points out that halal is part of quality infrastructure. The standards are not fiqh documents but include Islamic Rules and within SMIIC, halal is perceived as a technical issue thereof, halal standards are developed within
                    SMIIC Technical Committees where various standard projects on halal are studied by both technical and Islamic experts from 46 Member States and liaison organization such as International Islamic Fiqh Academy.</p>
